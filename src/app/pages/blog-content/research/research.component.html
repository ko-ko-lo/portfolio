    <h2>Quantitative Research Briefly Explained</h2>
    <p>
      Quantitative Research revolves around data. It includes things like
      Analytics, A/B Testing, and Key Performance Metrics. What makes
      Quantitative Research valuable is that it's comparable, measurable, and
      doesn't require direct interaction with users.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of research helps teams make better product decisions by
      revealing whether those decisions are effective or not.

    <h2>Qualitative Research Briefly Explained</h2>
    <p>
      Qualitative Research, on the other hand, is all about understanding
      people. It involves speaking with users or observing their behavior. This
      method is excellent for building empathy and gaining a deeper
      understanding of the individuals for whom the product is being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of Qualitative Research include Usability Testing or
      Observational Studies where you watch how people use a product in a
      natural environment.

    <h2>Practical Example: Improving User Engagement in a Yoga App</h2>
    <p>
      Let's imagine we have a yoga app that provides users with on-demand yoga
      classes. Recently, we noticed that many users are not completing their
      first session after signing up. To improve the user experience and boost
      engagement, we want to understand where users are dropping off during
      their initial yoga session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Quantitative Research, we learn that only 40% of new users who
      start a session actually finish it. The largest drop-off happens around
      the 10-minute mark of a 30-minute beginner class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantitative Research gives us this insight, showing us exactly when users
      are disengaging. Now, we can focus on this specific moment in the session
      to find out why users are leaving early.
    </p>

    <h3>Using Qualitative Research to Understand Why</h3>
    <p>
      To dig deeper, we conduct Qualitative Research in the form of User
      Interviews and Observational Studies. By talking with users and observing
      their behavior, we aim to understand why they drop off at this point.
    </p>
    <h4>Observed Problem</h4>
    <p>
      In our Observational Study, we find that new users feel overwhelmed or
      physically fatigued around the 10-minute mark. The pace of the beginner
      class, while manageable for regular users, seems too fast for true
      beginners. Some users also mention that they're unsure how to modify poses
      to suit their level.
    </p>
    <h4>Design Decision for a Possible Solution</h4>
    <p>
      Based on this qualitative feedback, we make a design decision to add short
      breaks at the 10-minute mark in beginner classes, providing users with an
      option to pause, hydrate, or adjust their posture. We also introduce
      on-screen tips for pose modifications and include more encouraging
      language during this critical phase of the session to reassure users they
      can go at their own pace.
    </p>

    <h3>Measuring the Impact with Quantitative Research</h3>
    <p>
      After implementing these changes, we return to Quantitative Research to
      measure the impact. We look at whether the number of users completing the
      session increases and analyze if there are fewer drop-offs around the
      10-minute mark. This approach helps us determine if our solution is
      successful in improving user engagement.

      Conclusion: The Power of Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Research
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both Qualitative and Quantitative Research methods are powerful tools for
      improving the user experience. Quantitative Research focuses on data,
      while Qualitative Research listens to and observes users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When combined, these two approaches provide a more comprehensive
      understanding of the product and its users, allowing you to develop
      thoughtful and effective solutions. By using both methods together, you
      can generate valuable insights and create a better product experience.
