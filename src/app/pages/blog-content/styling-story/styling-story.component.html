  <h2>Early Days with CSS</h2>
  <p>
    My journey into Web Development and CSS began a long time ago - at the end
    of 2012. Back in those days, some developers were still using Inline CSS, so
    learning CSS with classes felt almost avant-garde.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS back then was more challenging in many ways. Placing a container on the
    right side of a layout could lead into a "float" adventure and hours of
    questioning your skills. So the biggest challenge for me was layout: trying
    to make elements sit where they were supposed to.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was a lot of repetition. Variables weren't a thing yet, and even if
    there were ways to work more efficiently, browser compatibility often
    prevented you from using them. It was a real pain. No helper modules, no
    preprocessors, just raw CSS and hacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    I still remember how proud I was in 2013, learning responsive design. It
    felt like magic. Seeing containers break beautifully at different screen
    sizes was a true gamechanger.
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary: CSS was harder, less flexible, and full of repetition. But it
    was also deeply formative.

  <h2>SCSS and Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, my focus shifted more toward UX/UI Design. But development
    never stopped calling me back.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I returned to coding more seriously, I started exploring SCSS. And what
    a revelation it was.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began by creating base variables for colors, spacing, shadows, etc., and
    then semantic variables like "text-color-body", "bg-color-primary", and so
    on. Utility classes became more meaningful. Nesting, mixins, logic-based
    spacing ($spacing-unit-large: 0.44rem * 5) - it felt like writing code, not
    just styles.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2023, I even chose SCSS for my heart project: a web application for
    Yin-Style Yoga, Meditation, and Breathwork. It just made sense. SCSS was
    structured, logical, and expressive. I loved it.

  <h2>Discovering Tailwind CSS</h2>
  <p>
    While job hunting as a developer, I kept seeing Tailwind CSS pop up. In job
    postings. In articles. In projects. Eventually, I added it to my "To Learn"
    list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than take a course, I decided to dive in hands-on. My project was
    ongoing and scalable, so I thought: why not implement Tailwind directly?
  </p>
  <p>
    It was challenging at first. I was used to writing my own class names.
    Tailwind forced me to rewire how I thought about styling.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, I missed SCSS. I missed control. I struggled when things didn't
    work. But slowly, I got used to it. I started creating design tokens in
    "tailwind.config.js". I learned to love utility classes. I found power in
    "&#64;apply" and flexibility in inline styling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, writing Tailwind started to feel fun. Fast. Expressive. The
    structure I learned from SCSS helped me bring order to Tailwind's
    flexibility.

  <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
  <p>
    Styling has evolved. It's gotten more efficient and more powerful. But it's
    also gotten more complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm grateful I learned CSS when I did. The fundamentals are in my bones. I
    know <span class="text-italic">why</span> Tailwind works the way it does.
    That grounding helps.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-48">
    I know struggles younger developers may never face (like floating a
    sidebar), and I admire those who came before me, who built layouts with
    tables and inline styles.
