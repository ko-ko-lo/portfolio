  <!-- Titles in Angular-->
  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>Titles in Angular (No More Title Service)</h2>
    <p>
      Page titles play a crucial role in accessibility. They're the first thing
      screen readers announce, giving users immediate context about where they
      are. A well-structured title improves navigation - especially for users
      with assistive technologies or multiple tabs open.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite knowing their importance, I wasn't always consistent in how I
      handled them. Managing page titles manually within components made it easy
      to overlook or mismatch them, leading to a frustrating experience for
      users.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's when I discovered Angular's built-in route-based titles - a
      simpler, more structured way to ensure clear, accessible page titles
      across the entire application.
    </p>

    <h3>The Old Way: Updating Titles in Components</h3>
    <p>
      Previously, I was setting titles manually within routed components using a
      TitleService, like this:
    </p>

    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="
        'constructor(private titleService: TitleService) {}\n\nngOnInit(): void {\n  this.titleService.setTitle(\'Meditation Library | OpenStillness\');\n}'
      "
      [imageUrl]="'blog/bad.png'"
    >
    </app-code-good-bad>
    <p>This method worked, but it had its downsides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Repetitive & error-prone:</strong> I had to manually update the
        title in multiple components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Harder to maintain:</strong> A slight mismatch in one component
        could lead to inconsistent titles across the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No central control:</strong> I couldn't easily see or modify all
        page titles in one place.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Better Approach: Defining Titles in Routes</h3>
    <p>
      With Angular's built-in title strategy, you can define page titles
      directly in the routes. This makes them declarative, centralized, and
      easier to manage - no more manually updating them in components.
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="
        'export const routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: ROUTES.LIBRARY,\n    component: LibraryComponent,\n    title: \'Meditation Library | OpenStillness\',\n  },\n];'
      "
      [imageUrl]="'blog/good.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Now, Angular automatically updates the page title when users navigate to a
      new route. Less manual work, more accessibility.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Page titles should always follow a clear and consistent structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing titles in routes (instead of components) improves accessibility
        and reduces errors.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Heading Hierarchy -->
  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>Heading Hierarchy for Dynamic Components</h2>
    <p>
      I've always known that clear heading structures help users, especially
      those relying on screen readers, navigate content quickly and understand
      the organization of a page. But when working in a component-based system
      like Angular, I ran into an issue:
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I visually structured my pages with proper sections, the
      heading hierarchy was breaking because components weren't naturally aware
      of where they were placed within the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a reusable training card component might always use an h2,
      even if it's embedded inside a section where an h3 would make more sense.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem: Components Can't See Their Context</h3>
    <p>
      If each component blindly defines its own headings, you can end up with a
      messy structure like this:
    </p>

    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="
        '&lt;h1&gt;Yoga Routines&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Beginner Routines&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Sun Salutation Flow&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;!-- Should be an h3 --&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Deep Stretch Sequence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;!-- Should be an h3 --&gt;'
      "
      [imageUrl]="'blog/bad.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Here, the individual routine names should be h3s, but the component
      rendering them doesn't know where it sits in the overall page structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates a poor experience for screen reader users and assistive
      technologies, making it harder to understand the hierarchy of content.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fix: Pass the Heading Level as an Input</h3>
    <p>
      To solve this, I learned to make the heading level dynamic, allowing each
      component to adjust based on its context.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Modify the Component to Accept a headingLevel Input</h4>
    <p>
      First, modify the component to accept a headingLevel input and dynamically
      render the appropriate heading tag:
    </p>

    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/good.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>

    <p>
      In the component's TypeScript file, define a default heading level - in
      this case, h2:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode1"></app-code-good-bad>
    <h4>2. Set the Heading Level When Embedding the Component</h4>
    <p>
      Now, whenever I use this component, I can modify the heading level as
      needed:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode2"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      This ensures that each heading fits seamlessly into the page's structure -
      without breaking accessibility!
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Components should be flexible, not dictate their own heading levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Passing a heading level as an input makes it easy to maintain a clean,
        accessible structure across the entire app.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This was one of those accessibility issues I didn't notice at first, but
      once I fixed it, I realized how much smoother navigation became. Now, my
      components blend seamlessly into the overall page hierarchy, making
      content clearer for everyone.

  <!-- NG-Container-->
  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>ng-container Instead of div: Cleaning Up Unnecessary Markup</h2>
    <p>
      While reviewing my final HTML markup for accessibility, I noticed
      something strange - extra &lt;div&gt; wrappers cluttering the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I didn't think much of it. But then I realized these &lt;div&gt;
      elements weren't serving any real purpose - they weren't needed for
      styling, layout, or semantics. They were just there because I had wrapped
      structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf inside them.
    </p>

    <h3>The Issue: Unnecessary div Wrappers</h3>
    <p>Take this example where I loop through descriptions using *ngFor:</p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode3"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/bad.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      This works, but the &lt;div&gt; doesn't actually do anything. It exists
      purely because I needed a way to apply the directive.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fix: Use ng-container for Structural Directives</h3>
    <p>
      Then I remembered ng-container - a special Angular element that doesn't
      get rendered in the final HTML. By switching to it, I removed the
      unnecessary &lt;div&gt; while keeping the same functionality:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode4"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/good.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>Now, the final markup stays clean, without extra wrapper elements.</p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Unnecessary &lt;div&gt; elements add clutter</strong>
        and can make HTML harder to navigate, especially for assistive
        technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Use &lt;ng-container&gt; when you only need a structural
          directive</strong
        >
        - it keeps the final output lightweight and semantic.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Buttons for Actions -->
  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>Buttons Only for Actions, Not for Links</h2>
    <p>
      One thing I got wrong way too many times - and I bet I'm not alone - is
      that a button is not always a button. Sounds weird, right? But here's the
      deal:
    </p>
    <p>
      A &lt;button&gt; should be used for actions, while an &lt;a&gt; should be
      used for navigation. I used to assume that if something looked like a
      button, I should wrap it in a &lt;button&gt; tag. But functionality, not
      styling, determines whether it should be a &lt;button&gt; or an &lt;a&gt;.
    </p>
    <h3>The Key Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use &lt;button&gt; for actions</strong> like submitting forms,
        opening modals, or triggering UI changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use &lt;a&gt; for navigation</strong> - when clicking it takes
        you to another page, section, or anchor link.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where I Got It Wrong</h3>
    <p>Here's a mistake I made:</p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode5"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/bad.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      I used a &lt;button&gt; for navigation, which is incorrect because it's
      not performing an action - it's just taking the user somewhere else.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fix: Use &lt;a&gt; for Navigation</h3>
    <p>Instead, the correct approach is to use an &lt;a&gt; tag:</p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode6"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/good.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Now, screen readers and keyboard users correctly interpret it as a
      navigation link.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If it performs an action</strong>, use &lt;button&gt;.</li>
      <li><strong>If it navigates somewhere</strong>, use &lt;a&gt;.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Alt-text imgs inside links-->
  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>Alt-Text for Images Alone Inside Links</h2>
    <p>
      Even though I've used the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) alt decision
      tree for years, there was one mistake I kept making:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A linked image (used alone) needs alt text, even if it is a logo.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These aren't decorative images - they are functional images because they
      initiate an action. And functional images require alt text that describes
      the action being taken.
    </p>
    <h3>Where I Got It Wrong</h3>
    <p>
      I used to leave the alt attribute empty, thinking the logo was purely
      decorative:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode7"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/bad.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Mistake: The image is the only content inside the link, so screen readers
      get no information about what the link does.
    </p>
    <h3>The Fix: Describe the Action</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure accessibility, the alt text should convey what happens when the
      link is activated:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad
      [code]="exampleCode8"
      [imageUrl]="'blog/good.png'"
    ></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Now, screen readers will correctly announce: "OpenStillness Home, link",
      making it clear that clicking the logo takes the user to the homepage.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If an image is inside a link and it's the only content, it needs
        meaningful alt text.
      </li>
      <li>Alt text should describe the action the link performs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <app-divider></app-divider>

  <section class="container-m m-middle">
    <h2>Final Thoughts: Accessibility is a Continuous Journey</h2>
    <p>
      If there's one thing I've learned, it's this: Accessibility is never
      “done” - it's an ongoing process of learning, improving, and adapting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite my experience, I still found areas where I could do better. And
      that's okay! The important thing is to stay curious, listen to users, and
      be open to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every small improvement makes the web a more inclusive space, and that's
      something worth striving for.
