  <h2 class="mt-32">The Emotional Rollercoaster</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever worked on a personal tech project, you know the ride.</p>
  <p>
    At first I was optimistic: “This will be fun. How hard can it be?” Then came
    the frustration: debugging, weird API behavior, error messages that made me
    question my life choices. But eventually, after trial and error, something
    clicked. And when the plugin finally worked, I felt victorious: “I built
    this thing!”
  </p>

  <p class="mb-40">
    It reminded me that learning new tech is rarely linear. It’s try → fail →
    learn → repeat.

  <h2 class="mt-32">Why Plugins?</h2>

  <p>
    For those who don’t know: plugins in Figma are little helpers. They export
    colors, insert icons, generate data: small tools that make design work
    faster or easier. Basically, if Figma doesn’t do it by default, there’s
    probably a plugin for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve created several plugins, but for this talk I chose to share three of
    them:”
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hexify</strong> - turns color collections into code (SCSS, CSS,
      JSON)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>JSONify</strong> - exports content from Figma into structured JSON
      data
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pattern Hearts</strong> - a tiny plugin to spread a little joy
      through design
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-40">Each one came with its own set of challenges and lessons.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-32">Hexify: Learning by Doing</h2>

  <p>
    Hexify was my first plugin. It sounded simple: export Figma colors into
    code. But starting out, I had almost no knowledge of the Figma API. I
    skimmed the docs, watched a few YouTube videos, and then thought: “Alright,
    let’s try to build something real.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Step by step, I connected the dots. I discovered how to access variables,
    filter colors, and convert RGB values into Hex. Just when I thought I was
    done, I realized semantic tokens were referencing other colors: another dot
    to connect.

  <h3>Unexpected Token</h3>

  <p class="mb-40">
    I met the “Unexpected Token” error along the way. At some point, that vague
    short error message had me doubting everything.

  <h2 class="mt-32">JSONify: Automating My Own Workflow</h2>

  <p>
    My second plugin grew out of a personal project:
    <a href="https://openstillness.com/" target="_blank">Open Stillness</a>, a
    platform I’m building for Meditation, Breathwork, and Yin-Style yoga.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each piece of content, a pose, a meditation, a technique, is documented as a
    card in Figma. At some point, I needed a way to turn all those cards into
    structured data.
  </p>

  <h3>Enter JSONify</h3>

  <p>
    It meant diving into Figma’s node tree with a Depth-First Search algorithm,
    finding text layers buried inside frames and groups. I discovered I could
    use layer names as keys, exclude layers with a naming rule, and even split
    line breaks into arrays.
  </p>

  <p>
    That little mapping trick, from design layer to JSON output, unlocked
    everything. Suddenly, I wasn’t just designing content, I was building data
    structures straight out of Figma.

  <h2 class="mt-32 rainbow-text">Pattern Hearts: Joy Through Design</h2>

  <p>
    After Hexify and JSONify, I wanted something lighter. Inspired by an old art
    project where I drew patterned hearts on paper, I built Pattern Hearts. It
    is a plugin to add patterned hearts (and rainbow gradients!) to designs.
  </p>

  <p>
    It wasn’t just playful, it was also personal. Each heart stood for openness,
    empathy, and individuality. Pattern Hearts is a joyful plugin made to share
    a little love.

  <h2 class="mt-32">Takeaways: From Chaos to Creation</h2>

  <p>
    Looking back, these three plugins taught me more than just the Figma API:
  </p>

  <ul class="mb-40">
    <li>
      <strong>Start small.</strong> Even tiny projects can spark real growth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Embrace chaos.</strong> Trial and error is not failure, it’s the
      process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Follow your curiosity.</strong> The best tools often emerge from
      personal needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bring joy.</strong> Tech isn’t only about efficiency, it can also
      spread a little love.
    </li>
  </ul>
