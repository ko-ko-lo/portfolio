    <h2>1. Preparation of a Test Plan</h2>
    <h3>1.1 General Information</h3>
    <p>
      The test plan begins with basic details about the Usability Test: the
      product being tested, the focus areas, the responsible UX Experts, and any
      other relevant information, such as the time allocated per task.
    </p>
    <h3>1.2 Description of an Initial Scenario</h3>
    <p>
      The initial scenario sets the stage, helping the test user visualize a
      real-life situation. For instance:
    </p>
    <p class="text-italic scenario">
      You are a sales representative in the insurance industry. You are meeting
      a client who is interested in life insurance. You've arranged this meeting
      to present them with an offer. You are using new software that helps you
      create an accurate risk analysis.
    </p>
    <h3>1.3 Writing Test Objectives and Test Items</h3>
    <p>
      The core of the test plan revolves around the test objectives and test
      items, which are created based on the goals of the test.
    </p>
    <h4>Example of a Test Objective:</h4>
    <p class="text-italic scenario">
      Test how smoothly users are guided through a form's input fields to
      quickly generate an accurate life insurance quote.
    </p>
    <h4>Example of a Test Task:</h4>
    <p class="text-italic scenario">
      Your client provides you with the necessary details for a life insurance
      policy. Please enter all the information into the form. Stop when you
      reach the field for the policy term.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's helpful to start with simpler tasks to build the test user's
      confidence.
    </p>
    <h3>1.4 Play Through the Test Yourself</h3>
    <p class="mb-48">
      Before conducting the Usability Test, ensure that the tasks are achievable
      by playing through them yourself. A test run helps confirm that the
      product supports the tasks you've created.
    </p>

      <h3>Tips for Creating a Test Plan:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide a clear description of the test objectives and their expected

        </li>
        <li>Make sure all necessary information for the test is included.</li>
        <li>
          Set a time limit for task completion (but keep it hidden from the
          user).
        </li>
        <li>Use clear, simple language for all test tasks.</li>

  <h2>2. Conducting the Usability Test</h2>
  <p>Now it's time to see how easily users can complete the tasks.</p>
  <h3>2.1 Check the Test Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Before the participants arrive, double-check that all technical equipment,
    such as laptops or other devices, is functioning perfectly.
  </p>
  <h3>2.2 Welcoming and Instructing Participants</h3>
  <p>
    Greet the participants warmly and explain the process. It's helpful to
    reassure them that it's the software being tested, not them. This helps
    reduce any potential anxiety and makes them feel more comfortable.
  </p>
  <h3>2.3 Observing Test Users</h3>
  <p>
    As participants navigate the product, observe and collect feedback based on
    their interactions. Feedback can be recorded via video (with consent),
    screen recordings, or written notes.
  </p>
  <h3>2.4 Final Interview</h3>
  <p>
    After the tasks are completed, an optional interview allows you to gather
    further insights into participants' opinions and impressions of the product.
    You can also ask them to evaluate the design and overall experience.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-48">
    I like to ask participants to complete a (digital) questionnaire at the end
    for additional feedback.

    <h3>Tips for Conducting Usability Tests:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage participants to think aloud as they complete the tasks.</li>
      <li>Avoid interrupting unless absolutely necessary.</li>
      <li>
        Prompt participants to work through challenges rather than offering
        solutions right away.
      </li>
      <li>Offer refreshments when welcoming participants.</li>

    <h2>3. Analyzing the Test Data</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Categorizing Usability Problems</h3>
    <p>
      Usability testing aims to uncover challenges users face when completing
      tasks. To quantify these issues, I categorize them into three types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Minor Problems:</strong> Users hesitate briefly or show mild
        confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Moderate Problems:</strong> Users experience confusion or make a
        self-correcting error.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Severe Problems: </strong> Users are unable to complete a task
        or make multiple errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.2 Prioritizing Usability Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Once problems are categorized, I prioritize them based on urgency and how
      many users encountered the issue.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-32">Other important metrics may include:</p>
    <div class="d-flex gap-32">
      <div class="box-1 bg-medium-brown toolbox radius-l m-middle">
        <h3>Quantitative Metrics:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Success rate for tasks</li>
          <li>Time to complete tasks</li>
          <li>Number of errors or clicks</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>4. Writing a Test Report</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most critical parts of Usability Testing is sharing the results
    in a clear and persuasive way.
  </p>
  <h3>4.1 Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Begin the report with a brief summary of the Usability Test. Outline the
    goals, focus areas, and key findings. I also like to start on a positive
    note by highlighting strengths, such as: “During the Usability Test, the
    intuitive layout of the tool received high praise.”
  </p>
  <p>Next, describe the methodology, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participants: 5 (4 female, 1 non-binary), Age: 30 - 45</li>
    <li>Laboratory Testing</li>
    <li>1:1 sessions</li>
    <li>Tasks completed independently</li>
    <li>Followed by a post-test questionnaire</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4.2 Main Section</h3>
  <p>
    The main body of the report lists usability problems for each task, often
    supported by screenshots where appropriate. Alongside each issue, mention
    the task success rate and the number of errors found. Include actionable
    recommendations to improve the product.
  </p>
  <p>
    Usability problems should be prioritized to help the team focus on the most
    critical issues first.
  </p>
  <h3>4.3 Final Section</h3>
  <p class="mb-32">
    The final section gathers the opinions and reflections of the test users.
    Both positive and negative comments can be shared here (ideally quoted
    verbatim). If a questionnaire was used, summarize the results in this
    section.

    <h2>Conclusion on Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Usability Testing uncovers the needs and challenges users experience while
      interacting with a product. It provides data-driven insights, allowing
      design decisions to be based on facts, not assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not every aspect of a product can be tested, so it's wise to focus on
      critical or problematic areas. As observers during Usability Testing, we
      must resist the temptation to influence users.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-32">
      Prioritizing findings is crucial, taking into account the organization's
      goals and technical limitations. Lastly, communicating test results
      effectively is key to gaining stakeholder support for improvements.
