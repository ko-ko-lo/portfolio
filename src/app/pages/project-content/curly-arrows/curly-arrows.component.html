    <h2>1. Purpose &amp; Goal</h2>
    <p>Curly Arrows began with a keynote.</p>
    <p>
      To make my presentation feel more personal and engaging, I hand-drew small
      illustrations, including playful, imperfect arrows that added character
      and flow. While preparing, I realized: why not share these? Others might
      want to add that same expressive touch to their own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of Curly Arrows is to provide clean, hand-drawn arrows that stand
      out with personality, perfect for enriching user flows, websites, or
      presentations where standard arrows might go unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than just sharing assets, I wanted to build something useful,
      beautiful, and simple to use: a tiny plugin that brings joy into the
      design process.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Features &amp; Visual Design</h2>
    <p>
      Every arrow in Curly Arrows starts with a hand-drawn sketch. This gives
      each one a natural rhythm and personality. These sketches capture the
      playful imperfections that make the arrows feel expressive, dynamic, and a
      little unexpected.
    </p>
    <picture>
      <source srcset="projects/arrow-sketches.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <img
        src="projects/arrow-sketches.jpg"
        alt=""
        class="radius-l elevation-xs mb-32"
      />
    </picture>
    <p>
      To turn these sketches into interactive assets, I convert them into vector
      paths. This allows for flexibility inside Figma, particularly when it
      comes to stroke width. The plugin includes a stroke slider, giving users
      control over the thickness of the arrow lines, from 1px to 10px.
      Adjustments are visible instantly in the plugin preview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curly Arrows also comes with a curated palette of six colors, plus a deep
      charcoal gray. These options let users experiment quickly inside the
      plugin, while keeping the door open for full customization: once inserted
      into Figma, arrows behave like any native vector - users can change color,
      or apply any style they like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UI is intentionally simple and designed to make selection and
      customization effortless. It includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-64">
      <li class="mb-8">A live preview of each arrow</li>
      <li class="mb-8">A color picker with hover labels</li>
      <li class="mb-8">A stroke width slider with real-time updates</li>

    <h2>3. Development Insights</h2>
    <p>
      One of the trickiest parts was working with SVG paths exported from Figma.
      I wanted to give users the ability to change stroke width dynamically, but
      many of my initial arrow designs didn't include proper stroke attributes,
      especially if the paths had advanced stroke settings or were flattened
      during export.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to learn how to prepare the SVGs so that they remained editable, and
      how to inject stroke and stroke-width values via code before inserting
      them into Figma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a snippet that dynamically injects the selected stroke color and
      width into all &lt;path&gt; elements before the SVG is inserted into the
      canvas:

    <h2>4. Final Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      I'm really happy with how the arrows turned out - they feel playful,
      expressive, and fun to use. I also like the clean, simple UI that allows
      users to pick from curated colors and adjust stroke width without
      friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the technical side, this project helped me deepen my understanding of
      the Figma Plugin API, especially how to work with SVG paths and inject
      dynamic attributes like color and stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curly Arrows is now part of my growing family of playful plugins,
      alongside <a href="projects/figma-smiley-express">Smiley Express</a> and
      <a href="projects/figma-pattern-hearts">Pattern Hearts</a>.

      I've already received feedback about adding animation features. Let's see
      where this goes next ....
