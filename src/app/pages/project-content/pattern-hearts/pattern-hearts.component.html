    <h2>1. Purpose &amp; Goal</h2>
    <p>
      "Love Comes in All Patterns" was born from a simple wish: to spread a
      little more love and light into the world - and into our designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a time where division and exclusion often dominate the conversation,
      this plugin is a gentle counter-message. It's about celebrating diversity
      and expressing kindness, creativity, and connection through design. The
      heart shape stands for what unites us, while the different patterns
      represent the beauty of our individuality - across cultures, identities,
      backgrounds, and beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wanted to create something joyful and accessible. After working on
      more technical plugins, I felt the pull to make something playful -
      something that could put a smile on someone's face, whether they're a
      designer, developer, or just exploring Figma for fun.

      All patterned hearts are SVGs, which means they can be scaled endlessly
      without losing quality, and their colors can be customized directly within
      Figma.

      A little collection of playful ideas to show how these hearts can come to
      life in design. From blooming love to floating joy, here's how “Love Comes
      in All Patterns” can add charm, warmth, and a spark of creativity.

    <h2>4. Final Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This little plugin was a joyful space to play, create, and share something
      with heart. I loved giving a simple tool a meaningful twist, filling it
      with illustrated patterns and quiet metaphors for love, diversity, and
      togetherness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing each heart, picking the ones that felt just right, and imagining
      how they might live inside someone's design was a delight. Creating those
      playful demo scenes brought smiles and a welcome reminder that even small
      things can carry warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every piece of work, there's learning, growing, and a quiet build-up
      of confidence. The Figma Plugin API occasionally tested my patience
      (especially when things broke without a single error), but that too has
      made me a better debugger, and definitely a more resilient developer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-120">
      Most of all, I hope this plugin brings a bit of fun - to developers and
      non-developers alike - and that the magic button truly feels a little bit
      magical.
