    <h2>1. Purpose &amp; Goal</h2>
    <p>
      "Love Comes in All Patterns" was born from a simple wish: to spread a
      little more love into the world - and into our designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plugin is about celebrating diversity and expressing kindness,
      creativity, and connection through design. The heart shape stands for what
      unites us, while the different patterns represent the beauty of our
      individuality - across cultures, identities, backgrounds, and beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wanted to create something joyful and accessible. After working on
      more technical plugins, I felt the pull to make something playful -
      something that could put a smile on someone's face, whether they're a
      designer, developer, or just exploring Figma for fun.

    <h2>2. Features &amp; Visual Design</h2>
    <p>
      With that spirit in mind, the plugin's design is simple, playful, and full
      of heart. It offers an easy way to explore patterns, colors, and
      creativity - all wrapped in a joyful, user-friendly experience.

      All patterned hearts are SVGs, which means they can be scaled endlessly
      without losing quality, and their colors can be customized directly within
      Figma.

    <h2>3. Development Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The goal was to keep everything light and easy to use - but under the
      surface, a few puzzles needed solving. Here's what happened behind the
      scenes:
    </p>
    <h3>SVG Integration & Frame Removal</h3>
    <p>
      All hearts are stored as SVGs with one &lt;path&gt; each. When a heart is
      inserted into Figma, the SVG is converted into a Figma node using
      figma.createNodeFromSvg().
    </p>
    <p>
      But SVGs come wrapped in a frame by default - not ideal for this use case.
      So the actual VECTOR node inside is extracted and the frame removed to
      keep things clean and minimal inside the user's file.
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode1"></app-code-good-bad>
    <h3>The Gradient Struggle (And Solution)</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted a magic button that fills hearts with a rainbow gradient. But
      Figma doesn't support &lt;linearGradient&gt; from raw SVGs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The workaround:</strong> A heart is inserted into Figma first,
      then a GRADIENT_LINEAR fill applied via the plugin API.
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode2"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>This gives users a native Figma gradient they can edit if needed.</p>
    <h3>Handling Color Picker Logic</h3>
    <p>
      Colors selected in the plugin's UI are passed from ui.html to code.ts
      using window.postMessage(). Since Figma's API doesn't accept hex colors,
      they need to be converted to RGB in code:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode3"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Figma's API expects RGB values between 0 and 1 - so hex colors are
      converted by dividing by 255.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Final Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This little plugin was a joyful space to play, create, and share something
      with heart. I loved giving a simple tool a meaningful twist, filling it
      with illustrated patterns and quiet metaphors for love, diversity, and
      togetherness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing each heart, picking the ones that felt just right, and imagining
      how they might live inside someone's design was a delight. Creating those
      playful demo scenes brought smiles and a welcome reminder that even small
      things can carry warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every piece of work, there's learning, growing, and a quiet build-up
      of confidence. The Figma Plugin API occasionally tested my patience
      (especially when things broke without a single error), but that too has
      made me a better debugger, and definitely a more resilient developer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-120">
      Most of all, I hope this plugin brings a bit of fun - to developers and
      non-developers alike - and that the magic button truly feels a little bit
      magical.
