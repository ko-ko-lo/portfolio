    <h2>1. Purpose &amp; Goal</h2>
    <p>
      "Love Comes in All Patterns" was born from a simple wish: to spread a
      little more love and light into the world - and into our designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a time where division and exclusion often dominate the conversation,
      this plugin is a gentle counter-message. It's about celebrating diversity
      and expressing kindness, creativity, and connection through design. The
      heart shape stands for what unites us, while the different patterns
      represent the beauty of our individuality - across cultures, identities,
      backgrounds, and beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wanted to create something joyful and accessible. After working on
      more technical plugins, I felt the pull to make something playful -
      something that could put a smile on someone's face, whether they're a
      designer, developer, or just exploring Figma for fun.

    <h2>3. Development Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The goal was to keep everything light and easy to use - but under the
      surface, a few puzzles needed solving. Here's what happened behind the
      scenes:
    </p>
    <h3>SVG Integration & Frame Removal</h3>
    <p>
      All hearts are stored as SVGs with one &lt;path&gt; each. When a heart is
      inserted into Figma, the SVG is converted into a Figma node using
      figma.createNodeFromSvg().
    </p>
    <p>
      But SVGs come wrapped in a frame by default - not ideal for this use case.
      So the actual VECTOR node inside is extracted and the frame removed to
      keep things clean and minimal inside the user's file.
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode1"></app-code-good-bad>
    <h3>The Gradient Struggle (And Solution)</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted a magic button that fills hearts with a rainbow gradient. But
      Figma doesn't support &lt;linearGradient&gt; from raw SVGs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The workaround:</strong> A heart is inserted into Figma first,
      then a GRADIENT_LINEAR fill applied via the plugin API.
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode2"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>This gives users a native Figma gradient they can edit if needed.</p>
    <h3>Handling Color Picker Logic</h3>
    <p>
      Colors selected in the plugin's UI are passed from ui.html to code.ts
      using window.postMessage(). Since Figma's API doesn't accept hex colors,
      they need to be converted to RGB in code:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode3"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      Figma's API expects RGB values between 0 and 1 - so hex colors are
      converted by dividing by 255.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Final Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      This little plugin was a joyful space to play, create, and share something
      with heart. I loved giving a simple tool a meaningful twist, filling it
      with illustrated patterns and quiet metaphors for love, diversity, and
      togetherness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing each heart, picking the ones that felt just right, and imagining
      how they might live inside someone's design was a delight. Creating those
      playful demo scenes brought smiles and a welcome reminder that even small
      things can carry warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every piece of work, there's learning, growing, and a quiet build-up
      of confidence. The Figma Plugin API occasionally tested my patience
      (especially when things broke without a single error), but that too has
      made me a better debugger, and definitely a more resilient developer.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-120">
      Most of all, I hope this plugin brings a bit of fun - to developers and
      non-developers alike - and that the magic button truly feels a little bit
      magical.
