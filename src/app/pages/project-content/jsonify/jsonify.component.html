    <h2>2. Key Features and Algorithm Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      In JSONify, each Figma layer's name becomes a <strong>key</strong> in the
      JSON Output, and the text content within that layer becomes its
      corresponding <strong>value</strong>. For example, a layer named "title"
      containing the text "Hello World!" would generate the JSON entry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <span class="medium-berry">"title"</span>:
        <span class="medium-blue">"Hello World!"</span><br />
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple mapping keeps the JSON Output organized and easy to use,
      directly reflecting the design's structure.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of JSONify</h3>
    <ul class="mb-48">
      <li class="mb-16">
        <strong>Specific Layers with Prefixes are excluded:</strong><br />
        The prefix "exclude-" is used to skip layers that are not wanted in the
        JSON Output. This gives control over what gets exported.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-16">
        <strong>Auto Layout Layers are Ignored:</strong><br />
        Auto layout layers are automatically excluded to ensure the exported
        JSON remains straightforward.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-16">
        <strong>Layer Names Become Keys:</strong><br />
        Each layer's name is transformed into a key in the JSON object, making
        the output structured and easy to use.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arrays in JSONify</h3>
    <ul class="mb-48">
      <li class="mb-16">
        <strong>Line Breaks Create Arrays:</strong><br />
        When a text layer contains line breaks (\n), the text is split into an
        array. Each line becomes a separate entry in the JSON, making it easy to
        handle lists or bullet points.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-16">
        <strong>Grouped Layers as Arrays:</strong><br />
        Groups in Figma are treated as arrays. Each child layer within the group
        becomes an array entry, keeping it aligned with the design hierarchy.
      </li>
    </ul>

      </picture>
      <figcaption>Organize content into arrays through line breaks</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Algorithm Highlights</h3>
    <p>
      At the heart of JSONify lies the
      <strong>Level-Order Traversal Algorithm</strong> - a classic technique
      commonly used to traverse trees and graphs.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-16">
      The purpose of this Algorithm is to ensure every layer in the Figma
      hierarchical layer structure is traversed in an orderly, level-by-level
      manner. By systematically processing each layer, the Plugin can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extract text content from layers and transform it into JSON.</li>
      <li>
        Recognize groups, arrays, and nested structures to preserve the
        hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-8">
        Skip irrelevant layers (like those prefixed with "exclude-").
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This Algorithm is the <strong>Engine of the Plugin</strong>, enabling it
      to handle complex Figma documents efficiently and accurately.
    </p>
    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>
      The Algorithm starts at the root node of the selected layers and uses a
      queue to traverse each node level by level. Here's a simplified code
      snippet demonstrating the process:
    </p>
    <div class="scrollable-container">
      <pre class="radius-l">
        <code [innerHTML]="codeSnippet"></code>

    <h2>4. Reflections on the Creative Process</h2>
    <p>
      When I first had the idea for JSONify, the Level-Order Algorithm
      immediately came to my mind. From that starting point, I began to think
      about how to mirror Figma's hierarchical structure in the JSON Output.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first "aha!" moments was realizing I could use Figma layer
      names as keys for the JSON object. Since JavaScript objects are made of
      key-value pairs, this approach allowed the Plugin to seamlessly translate
      Figma designs into structured data.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own use case - exporting consistent yoga card data - I needed a way
      to exclude certain layers, like static headlines, from the export. Again,
      layer names provided a simple but elegant solution: using a prefix like
      exclude-.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groups presented another challenge. To handle arrays in the JSON Output, I
      decided that grouped layers in Figma would act as arrays in the exported
      data. However, I also needed a way to process multi-line text as arrays,
      particularly for bullet point lists. That's when the idea to use \n (line
      breaks) as a delimiter likely emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Plugin meets my current needs, I look forward to using it
      regularly and gathering feedback from others over time. With user
      insights, I might refine its functionality.
