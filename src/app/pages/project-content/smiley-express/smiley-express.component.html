    <h2>1. Purpose &amp; Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Smiley Express began as a playful side project for a keynote on plugin
      development. To illustrate the emotional rollercoaster of building a Figma
      plugin, I created a series of hand-drawn emojis - each one reflecting a
      moment from the journey. The audience's reaction was immediate and warm:
      they smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      That response sparked the idea to share these illustrations more broadly.
      I noticed there weren't many Figma plugins offering hand-crafted,
      expressive visuals - especially ones that felt personal and a bit
      non-standard. Smiley Express aims to fill that gap by offering a library
      of mood-based emojis, designed for anyone who wants to communicate
      visually, quickly, and with personality.

    <h2>2. Features &amp; Visual Design</h2>

    <p>
      Users can choose from six vibrant color combinations, plus a neutral gray.
      The design principle is simple but effective: the facial expression is
      rendered in a darker shade than the outline, drawing attention to the
      emotion being conveyed. Colors can be selected directly within the plugin
      UI, and once inserted into Figma, every part of the emoji remains fully
      editable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The emojis are organized across six main moods: Happy, Sad, Angry,
      Excited, Calm, and Anxious, accessible via a tab-based menu. Each mood
      features a variety of nuanced expressions. For example, the Anxious
      category includes Sweaty, Nervous, Stressed, and Worried.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inserting an emoji is effortless: one click, and it's placed on Figma
      canvas - ready to be used or customized.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-48">
      To showcase the plugin, I've included two UI images: one showing the
      default state (Happy mood, dark gray), and another featuring the Anxious
      mood in golden colors.

    <h2>3. Development Insights</h2>
    <p class="mb-32">
      Smiley Express was built with a strong focus on dynamic SVG manipulation
      and Figma's plugin API. Each emoji is stored as an SVG string with
      semantic classes for facial features (.base, .face), enabling color
      customization through simple regex replacements:
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode1"></app-code-good-bad>

    <p class="mb-32">
      To insert an emoji into the canvas, the SVG is parsed and sanitized before
      passing it to figma.createNodeFromSvg():
    </p>
    <app-code-good-bad [code]="exampleCode2"></app-code-good-bad>
    <p>
      One challenge was ensuring a consistent group structure and avoiding
      unwanted frames in Figma. Instead of relying on grouping logic
      post-insertion, clean SVG markup proved to be the most reliable approach.

    <h2>4. Final Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past year of developing Figma plugins, I've seen firsthand how
      much the Figma developer experience has evolved. Error messages have
      become clearer, API responses more predictable, it feels like the platform
      is really listening to developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Smiley Express, I wanted to focus on something playful rather than
      overly technical. That kept the process fun and refreshing, and definitely
      spared me a few gray hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm getting more comfortable with the Figma API, and I'm already looking
      forward to the next plugin adventure!
