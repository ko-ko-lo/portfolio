  <h2 class="mt-48">Why was this platform created?</h2>
  <p>
    What started as a personal solution for organizing my yoga routines has
    evolved into a full-fledged mindfulness platform. Initially, I struggled
    with scattered paper notes, which led me to develop a structured digital
    library for Yin-style Yoga poses and routines. As I refined the concept, the
    platform expanded to include guided Meditations, Breathwork techniques, and
    more.

      >As both the designer and developer, I have built this platform from the
      ground up</strong
    >
    - crafting the UI, structuring the architecture, and ensuring accessibility.
    More than just a coding project, this is a way to share my experience with
    mindfulness, making Meditation, Yin-Style Yoga, and Breathwork more
    accessible to others.

    Project Phases: <br />
    The Evolution of Open Stillness
  </h2>
  <p class="main-margin">
    Every project starts with a simple idea. What began as a structured way to
    organize Yin-Style Yoga routines has grown into a comprehensive mindfulness
    platform. This journey is divided into key phases, each adding new features
    and refining the user experience. From the initial foundation to enhanced
    content, accessibility, and personalization, the platform continuously
    evolves to bring Meditation, Breathwork, and Yin-Style Yoga to a wider
    audience.
