        <h3>Bringing Yoga to Life: <br />My Heart Project</h3>
        <p>
          The project is a web application that merges my passion for yoga,
          design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was born from my personal journey in yoga, combining
          thoughtful illustrations and dynamic content to create a calming,
          user-friendly platform for Yin-Style Yoga. It's a true reflection of
          my love for crafting meaningful digital experiences that inspire
          mindfulness and well-being.
