    <h2>Roots in Art and Design</h2>
    <p>
      From an early age, art became my way of expressing feelings and thoughts
      that were often too complex for words. It offered me a space where I could
      explore my emotions, meditate, and develop personally. Art has always been
      a form of self-expression and growth for me, shaping not only my
      creativity but also my approach to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deep connection to art naturally led me to pursue a formal education
      in Product Design, where I embraced the principles of the Bauhaus
      philosophy. At the core of this philosophy is the belief that, to create
      something meaningful, you must first understand its materials, behaviors
      and processes. This mindset was instilled in me throughout my studies,
      particularly in the traditional craft of glassmaking. I learned to shape
      glass with my own hands, understanding its nuances and limitations before
      translating that knowledge into design. This approach - of deeply knowing
      before creatingâ€”has remained a guiding principle in all aspects of my
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I'm designing physical products, creating digital art, or writing
      code, I always start by exploring the underlying materials, tools, and
      possibilities. It's a mindset that reminds me to dig deep, to understand,
      and to craft with intention.

    <h2>Becoming a UX/UI Designer</h2>
    <p>
      After completing my studies in product design, I initially began my career
      in that field, but soon realized that the opportunities for growth - both
      professionally and personally - were limited. This led me to explore new
      paths, and while still working full-time as a product designer, I began
      studying graphic design in search of fresh challenges and new
      opportunities to develop my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't long before I turned my attention to software development. The
      ever-growing demand for developers and the continuous opportunity for
      learning drew me in. I've always had a strong desire to keep learning and
      the systematic nature of development fascinated me. Just as I wanted to
      understand the craft of glassmaking in order to design meaningful
      products, I wanted to understand code so I could create powerful,
      functional digital designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, I focused on web development. But, somewhat by chance, my
      journey into UX/UI Design began when my manager asked me to step in as a
      full-time designer - unable to find someone with both design and coding
      skills. It wasn't a role I had planned for, but as I dove deeper into the
      world of user experience and interface design, it felt like a natural fit.
      I combined the problem-solving skills I had developed in software with my
      creative background in design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven by curiosity and the desire to master this new field, I dedicated
      myself to self-study. Through books, courses, and hands-on experience
      working for a variety of companies - from tech startups to consultancies
      and large corporations - I honed my skills in UX/UI Design.

    <h2>Returning to Development</h2>
    <p>
      While I enjoyed the creative aspects of UX/UI Design, the problem-solving
      nature of software development was always calling me back. There was
      something deeply fulfilling about the systematic approach and the way
      development challenges you through logic and creativity. Over time, I
      realized that while design allowed me to create visually engaging
      experiences, it was development that truly captivated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while, I hesitated to make the shift. Although I had experience as a
      developer, my skills weren't up to date, and I didn't feel confident
      enough to apply for developer positions. But at some point, I decided it
      was time to make a change. I took a break from UX/UI work to focus on
      completing software development certifications, pushing myself to refresh
      and sharpen my coding skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to development felt like coming home. It reignited my passion
      for problem-solving and the thrill of creating something functional and
      tangible. For me, development is like solving a puzzle - systematic,
      challenging, and deeply creative. It's the perfect blend of logic and
      imagination, and it allows me to take an idea and turn it into something
      that people can interact with and benefit from. I've come to appreciate
      that no matter where my journey takes me, coding remains an essential part
      of it.
