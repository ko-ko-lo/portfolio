    <h2>Exploring the Intersection of Design, Code and Art</h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of everything I do is a desire to understand deeply. Whether
      it's learning the craft of glassmaking, solving problems through design or
      writing code. I believe that to create something meaningful, you need to
      dive into its core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art is where I express emotions that words can't capture, while design is
      about solving problems with intention. Development, for me, is where logic
      meets creativity—it's the process of turning ideas into something real and
      functional. Though these disciplines are unique, they all reflect my
      passion for exploring, learning, and creating thoughtful experiences.

    <h2>Discover My Work</h2>
    <p class="mb-32">
      Explore my most recent project to see how I bring ideas to life through a
      combination of design and development. This project was born from my
      personal journey with yoga, aiming to create a calming, user-friendly
      platform for Yin-Style Yoga. It's a true reflection of my love for
      crafting meaningful digital experiences that inspire mindfulness.
